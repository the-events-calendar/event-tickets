== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any troubleshooting steps I should try before I post a new thread in the support forum? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of Event Tickets. If you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current and running the latest code as well. Also be sure to check our [knowledgebase](https://evnt.is/1aoc).

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just Event Tickets is running on your site. If the issue persists, revert to the default [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say ‚Äútough luck‚Äù if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Free plugin users can post in the [Event Tickets support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/event-tickets/). Our team reviews that forum weekly to look for bug reports.

If you're already an [Event Tickets Plus](https://evnt.is/18wk) subscriber, you're entitled to our actively-monitored [Premium Support](https://evnt.is/1aoe) on our website. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all premium support tickets within 24 hours during the business week.

= What's the difference between Event Tickets and Events Tickets Plus?

Event Tickets is our free ticketing plugin that has all the basics you need to sell tickets and collect RSVPs on your website. You can use Event Tickets with or without The Events Calendar.

[Event Tickets Plus](https://evnt.is/18wk) is a premium plugin that runs alongside Event Tickets and enhances it with extra features, including custom registration fields, shortcodes, WooCommerce integration, our [mobile ticketing app](https://evnt.is/1aof) and more.

= Do I need The Events Calendar to run Event Tickets? =

Nope! Event Tickets works with or without The Events Calendar. Even if you don't have The Events Calendar, you can create RSVPs and tickets on WordPress pages and posts.

= Can I email attendees using Event Tickets? =

Yes. Event Tickets automatically sends an email confirmation after attendees register or RSVP for an event. If the attendee purchases a ticket, the confirmation email will also provide a ticket to scan at the door for admission.
