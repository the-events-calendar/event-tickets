- use version `1.5.2` of `slic` to get the `nvm` working env
- `slic use` and `slic shell` into the plugin
- `nvm use`, with optional `nvm install` to install the node version required by the plugin
- `npm init playwright@latest` in the plugin root directory
- setup the project for Javascript, not Typescript, in the `tests/blocks` directory
- do not install Playwright browsers
- in the `playwright.config.js` file change the `use.baseUrl`  to `http://wordpress.test`
- run `npx playwright install` a first time to install the required browser; Playwright requires its own binaries to work correctly; this should be required once per container spin-up
