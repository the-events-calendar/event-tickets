### [5.1.1] 2021-03-04

* Fix - Compatibility with WordPress 5.7 and jQuery 3.5.X [ET-992]
* Fix - Attendees will no longer have a new user created (if they did not already exist), which was introduced in Event Tickets 5.1.0. To turn this on, you can simply add the filter `add_filter( 'tribe_tickets_attendee_create_user_from_email', '__return_true' );`
* Fix - Prevent the Attendee Registration page from having the title coming from draft pages. [ETP-360]
* Fix - Highlight the "Ticketed" and "Unticketed" filters in the WordPress when they're applied. [ET-1022]
* Fix - Prevent duplicate tickets from showing in post loops. [ETP-639]
* Fix - Ensure ticket object caches return normally in all circumstances, preventing potential "Sold Out" messaging from happening in certain hosting environments. [ET-1023]
* Fix - Set the default `iac` argument value in the single ticket REST API endpoint to add tickets since it is an optional argument to be sent.
* Tweak - Added new `Ticket Holder Name` and `Ticket Holder Email Address` columns to the Attendees Report export CSV file and update the previous `Customer` columns to label as `Purchaser`. [ETP-652]
* Tweak - Tweaked SQL queries for MySQL 8+ compatibility. [ET-1021]

* Feature - New Attendees ORM functionality allows creating and updating attendees. [ETP-366]
* Feature - New Orders ORM can be used by calling `tribe_tickets_orders()` and allows interfacing with Event Tickets Plus commerce providers. [ETP-366]
* Fix - Remove the duplicate Attendees heading from the Attendees Report screen when using Tribe Commerce tickets. [ETP-366]
* Tweak - New admin manager code to help us consolidate modals going forward with a comprehensive templating and form processing solution. [ETP-366]
* Tweak - Enforce capitalization for the text for action buttons on the Attendees Report screen. [ETP-624]
* Tweak - A new filter was introduced to help avoid problems where ticket caching has problems with certain hosting environments that cause tickets to show as Sold Out. Disable ticket caching with `add_filter( 'tribe_tickets_ticket_object_is_ticket_cache_enabled', '__return_false' );` [ETP-366]
* Tweak - Start tracking attendee email activity in a meta record so that there's a better ability for determining if an attendee email was sent, where to, and how many times it was re-sent. [ETP-366]
* Tweak - Added filters: `tribe_tickets_admin_manager_request`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_repository_set_attendee_args`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_repository_set_attendee_args_`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_repository_save_extra_attendee_data_args`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_repository_save_extra_attendee_data_args_`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_repository_create_order_for_attendee_order_args`, `tribe_tickets_repositories_order_statuses`, `tribe_tickets_repositories_order_public_statuses`, `tribe_tickets_repositories_order_private_statuses`, `tribe_tickets_repositories_order_create_order_for_ticket_order_args`, `tribe_tickets_ticket_object_is_ticket_cache_enabled`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_activity_log_data`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_lookup_user_from_email`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_create_user_from_email`, `tribe_tickets_attendee_create_user_from_email_send_new_user_info`, `tribe_tickets_handler_email_max_resend_limit`, `tribe_tickets_repositories_order_map`

* Tweak - Display all of a post's order tabs in the Attendees Report admin screen. Example: if a post's ticket provider was Tribe Commerce and such tickets were sold, then the post's provider changed to WooCommerce Tickets, the Attendees Report screen should show both the Tribe Commerce order history tab and the WooCommerce order history tab, regardless of which ticket provider is currently the default.
