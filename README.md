Welcome to the Event Tickets repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source code and keep track of development.

Event Tickets provides a simple way for visitors to RSVP or purchase tickets to your events. As a standalone plugin, it enables you to add RSVPs or tickets to posts or pages. When paired with [The Events Calendar](https://evnt.is/18tg), you can add that same functionality directly to your event listings.

We recommend to stay up to date about everything happening in the project by [following @TheEventsCal](https://twitter.com/TheEventsCal) on Twitter.

If you are not a developer, please use the [Event Tickets plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/) on WordPress.org.
