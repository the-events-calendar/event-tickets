# SLR

## Development

This plugins development should happen along a local instance of the Service running on `http://localhost:3000`.

Please, refer to the [Service documentation][2] to know how to set up a local instance of the Service.

The test must-use plugin is the `tests/_data/mu-plugins/slr-test.php` one.
